About | ScrambleSpell is a simple C++ program that scrambles the content of a an array from a users input around in various ways, and outputs the results on the terminal or through an output file. I began this project as a way challenge myself and further my knowledge of array manipulation within the programming language C++. Additionally, I used my schools(Chemeketa Community College) basic C++ program template for my project, which conveniently handled backend aspects such as version control, editor configuration, and build automation. This allowed me to focus on writing the core logic of my program.

Program Info | To change the input variable modify the following in the image below by modifying the size to match the array, and modfying all of the arrays to match if you want to see the various ways the program scrambles the array
